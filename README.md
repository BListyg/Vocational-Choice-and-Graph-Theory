# Vocational-Interests-Data

I collected vocational interest data from ~1200 O^NET Webpages to play around with. 

I plan to write a full blog post showing a modelling workflow that ultimately builds up to a full multi-level model in Stan predicting income from RIASEC scores. 

There's also cool network data in the CSM and CCM matrices that I will do something with (at the very least, the visualization will be pretty).
